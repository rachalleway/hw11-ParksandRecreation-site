          <p class="img_card_body">
            The Pawnee City Hall is an iconic location in the show, namely because it is where the gang reports for work each day, where crucial work relationships were formed, and where a bulk of the show takes place. We mostly see the interiors of the landmark, including the famous murals of Pioneer Hall, Andy’s shoe-shine spot during his brief stint as a shoe-shiner before he joined the team, and the office of the Parks and Recreations Department.

            Pawnee Public Libary
          </h1>
          <p class="img_card_body">
            The library department runs the libraries in Pawnee, and the feud between the library department and the Parks and Recreations department is no joke. Leslie Knope makes her hatred for those within the library department well known, calling them “diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats”, and referring to them as “punk-ass book jockeys”. The Library Department is run by none other than Tammy 2, Ron Swanson’s extremely chaotic and disturbing ex-wife.

            Indiana's Smallest Park
          </h1>
          <p class="img_card_body">
            Leslie Knope unveiled Indiana’s Smallest Park after the last pay phone was removed from the city, and Leslie planned to turn that patch of concrete into the smallest park in Indiana. The park is a poignant spot, and the park was created because Ben Wyatt, Leslie’s boyfriend tells Leslie that this will be the last project they work on together post break-up. Leslie tries to slow down the project in an attempt to keep them together. Eventually, when the park is finally open, Leslie tells Ben that they can continue dating, and is willing to jeopardize her campaign for city council in order to be together.          </p>

            The Snakehole Lounge          
          </h1>
          <p class="img_card_body">
            The Snakehole Lounge was defined as Pawnee's “sickest nightclub”, and was heavily featured over Park and Recreation’s seven season-run. One iconic episode is “The Fight”, when Tom unveils his new alcoholic beverage, labelled ‘Snake Juice’. The beverage is incredibly strong, and we see everyone from the Parks and Recreations department get flat-out drunk, and it’s one of the most hilarious scenes the show has to offer. The lounge also holds a special place in Tom Haverford’s  heart – it’s where he meets the bartender, Lucy, and she’s the woman he eventually proposes to.          </p>

          </h1>
          <p class="img_card_body">
            JJ’s Diner is an iconic establishment on the show, famous for its waffles and for being Ron’s and Leslie’s favourite restaurant. On the show, the diner is said to have opened in 1976, and has been a staple for the citizens of Pawnee ever since its opening. Ron Swanson’s favourite order, and one of JJ’s breakfast dishes, is the ‘Four Horse-Meals of the Egg-Pork-alypse’, and is a ridiculous amount of food. The order includes a twelve-egg scramble, bacon, sausages, ham, has browns, chicken-fried steak, and a stack of buttermilk pancakes.          </p>
