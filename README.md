# hw11-ParksandRecreation-site

Though our commit history reflects some imbalances, there was a similar amount of work spread out between the team. Rachalle worked on the home and characters page, Jessica on the locations page, and Christopher on the past events page. There may have been discrepencies reflected on the commit hisotry because of the way things were commited to the repo and merged with the main branch. We ran into issues with resizing our pages for tablet and phone as well as issues with deployment and figuring out how to link our pages together.

When working on the home page, I made the mistake of renaming my index.html to home.html them realized it created many issues when deploying it. I then renamed it back to index.html, and updated the corresponding links in the header. However, it still seems to want to look for a home.html file instead of the index.html file that I renamed it to. Not sure why it didn't update that when everything else seemed to go through.
